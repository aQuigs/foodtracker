# Agent handoff

Read [STATUS](../STATUS.md) first for current state. Then this for orientation.

## What
Browser-based food tracker. Single-user, localStorage, no backend. Static site on GitHub Pages.

## Where things live
- [STATUS](../STATUS.md) — current state, in-flight PRs (only non-`specs/` doc besides CLAUDE.md/README)
- [MILESTONES](./MILESTONES.md) — M0–M3 roadmap
- [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — conventions, stack, commands, layering
- `specs/NNN-name/` — per-milestone specs
- `specs/decisions/` — ADRs (append-only)

## Architecture
Strict layering — [ADR 0005](./decisions/0005-layered-architecture.md):

```
ui  →  domain  ←  persistence
        ↑
       app
```

`domain/` is pure. `persistence/` is behind an interface. `ui/` never touches storage. `app.ts` is the only thing that knows all three.

## How we work
- One milestone at a time. **Pause for user review between milestones.**
- **All changes go via PR** so user can preview the GH Pages deploy.
- **Every PR runs through adversarial-review + `/simplify` subagents before user sees it** ([ADR 0006](./decisions/0006-pr-review-pipeline.md))
- Strict TDD ([ADR 0004](./decisions/0004-strict-tdd.md))
- TypeScript everywhere incl. tests
- Vite → `dist/` → GH Pages. PR previews via `rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1`.
- localStorage, single versioned JSON blob, validator at the boundary

## Style
- Terse over verbose (user preference)
- Comments only for *why*, never *what*
- No backward-compat shims for unreleased internal code
- No `Co-Authored-By` in commits
- Don't delete PR template items, just check/uncheck

## Don't
- Cross layers wrong (UI → persistence, domain → DOM, etc.)
- Add a framework (React/Svelte/Vue)
- Swap to IndexedDB until food DB > ~1000 entries
- Swap the test runner
- Add cloud sync before all planned milestones ship
- Skip the failing-test-first step
- Run past a milestone boundary without user review
- Merge to main without a PR
- Put plan/design docs outside `specs/`

## Still TBD
- Linter/formatter (Prettier/ESLint) — TBD as repo grows
- Cloud sync architecture — deferred past current plan
